00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
TECH RAN: We're drifting free. The loop is gone. I think… we made it.

171
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
TECH RAN: We're free‑drifting. Vectors are clean.

172
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
[Empty band] '—'

173
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Darkness swallows our noise; the rift starves.

174
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
We ride the silence and wait for release.

175
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
[Silence] Only the hull ticks as it cools.

176
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
CAPTAIN LIRA: Prepare to ride it out in silence.

177
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
TECH RAN: The echo line is gone. No more repeats.

178
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
[No transmission] —

179
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
CAPTAIN LIRA: Let this be the last signal we follow blindly.

180
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
[Fade out] End of transmission.
